                            <p>Throughout the year several special events such as marathons, bike competitions and
                                endurance races take place at Wisconsin state park properties. On DNR lands, special
                                events are defined as a temporary use of department property for an activity that is
                                otherwise not specifically allowed or which involves one or more of the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Exclusive use or closure of all or part of a property;</li>
                                <li>Restricts or limits use of a property by non-participants;</li>
                                <li>Placement of temporary structures or event apparatus;</li>
                                <li>Sale or offering of beverages, food or merchandise;</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Special events require a permit. In specific circumstances, the permit requirement may be
                                waived by the property manager. The permit will describe the terms and conditions under
                                which the event will be allowed.</p>

                            <p>If you are interested in hosting an event at Lakeshore State Park, please give our
                                property manager a call at 414-274-4281. The Park is a popular site for runs and races
                                during summer months. Scheduling with the property manager is recommended a minimum of 2
                                months prior to the event date.</p>

                            <p>Lakeshore State Park has become one of the most photographed backdrops in Milwaukee.
                                Scenes from the Park have been used in television shows, publications and phone apps. It
                                also serves as a popular site for wedding, engagement and graduation photos.</p>

                            <p><strong>Professional photographers*</strong> who are hired for a fee and are taking the
                                pictures at the Park do have to get a Commercial License from the Park before the shoot.
                                The fee for the License is $50, and the permit is good for a year from issuance. We also
                                ask that both professional and amateur photographers stay on the trails or mowed grass,
                                and do not enter the prairies. For more information, to obtain a permit and to ensure
                                your planned photo shoot does not conflict with a major special event, please contact
                                our Park manager at <a href="tel:+14142744281">414-274-4281</a>.</p>

                            <p>*Professional photography does not include ones for personal use (such as vacation photos
                                or 'selfies') in which no monetary profit is obtained.</p>
